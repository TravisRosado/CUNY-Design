            <h3>QueensBorough Community College</h3>
            <h4>Degree:A.S </h4>
            <p>The A.S. degree program in Digital Art and Design is structured to prepare students to enter the greatly expanding field of new media, a field which has been revolutionized in the last 20 years with the advent of computer graphics programs. In addition to four basic courses that provide a solid background in art, students take five courses in digital art and design, which develop computer skills for fine and applied arts. A required course in the History of Graphic Design gives students an overview of graphic design in historical context. A suggested Art History elective provides a broad knowledge of art in general. With this preparation, students will be able to design for industry.
            </p>
                <p>Digital Art and Design students should take ARTS-192 and ET-710 as Writing Intensive course requirements.
            </p>
            <p>Specifically, the program provides students with:
                <br>
<br>
· knowledge of current widely used programs in the design field
                <br>
<br>
· proficiency in operating these programs
                <br>
  <br>
· understanding of the means and methods of mass (production of artwork using these programs)
                <br>
                <br>
· skills for working with and understanding the computer and the technical problems associated with operating a computer
                  <br>
                <br>
            
· knowledge based on awareness of the importance of aesthetic judgment in making design decisions.</p>
